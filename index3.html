    <h1>Introduction to Deep Learning</h1>
    <p>Deep Learning is transforming the way machines understand, learn, and interact with complex data. Deep learning mimics neural networks of the human brain, enabling computers to autonomously uncover patterns and make informed decisions from vast amounts of unstructured data.</p>

    <h2>How Deep Learning Works?</h2>
    <p>Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that collaborate to process input data. In a fully connected deep neural network, data flows through multiple layers, where each neuron performs nonlinear transformations, allowing the model to learn intricate representations of the data.</p>
    <p>In a deep neural network, the input layer receives data, which passes through hidden layers that transform the data using nonlinear functions. The final output layer generates the modelâ€™s prediction.</p>

    <h2>Deep Learning in Machine Learning Paradigms</h2>
    <p class="highlight">Supervised Learning:</p>
    <p>Neural networks learn from labeled data to predict or classify, using algorithms like CNNs and RNNs for tasks such as image recognition and language translation.</p>

    <p class="highlight">Unsupervised Learning:</p>
    <p>Neural networks identify patterns in unlabeled data, using techniques like Autoencoders and Generative Models for tasks like clustering and anomaly detection.</p>

    <p class="highlight">Reinforcement Learning:</p>
    <p>An agent learns to make decisions by maximizing rewards, with algorithms like DQN and DDPG applied in areas like robotics and game playing.</p>
